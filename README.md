# capacitive-ultrasonic-solid-state-button
This repository works as an historical registry of this idea.

The point of this repo is ensure that this idea remains free for everyone to use but not to profit.

The capacitive ultrasonic solid state button has a velley where an electric field detects proximity. This virtual button is defined by a cavity or a geometric distribution.

When an activating device, eg, a finger, "press" or activates the button, its mechanical propierties, for instance, the plasticity of skin, allow it to modify the capacitive field, so one or a given number or ultrasonic actuators emmit an ultra sonic wave or signal. The capacitive field can be inwards or outwards relative to the "virtual button". Also, the ultrasonic wave can be inwards or outwards relative to the "virtual button"

A system of feedback allows the ultrasonic actuator to detect the position of the finger and change de phase of the ultrasonic wave so "it feels like a mechanical feedback" based on the principle of ultrasonic levitation and the actuator position and dynamics.

This sytsem includes the composed feedback of another mechanical and non mechanical sound or electromagnetic systems
