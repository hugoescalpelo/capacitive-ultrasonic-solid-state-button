This repository works as an historical registry of this idea.

The point of this repo is ensure that this idea remains free for everyone to use but not to profit.

The capacitive ultrasonic solid state button has a velley where an electric field detects proximity

When an finger "press" the button, its plasticity allow the skin to enter the capacitive field, so one or given number or ultrasonic actuators emmit an ultra sonic wave. 

A system of feedback allows the ultrasonic actuator to detect the position of the finger and change de phase of the ultrasonic wave so "it feels like a mechanical feedback" based on the principle of ultrasonic levitation.

This sytsem includes the composed feedback of another mechanical and non mechanical sound or electromagnetic systems
